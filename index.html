        <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.

Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. I use my left hand to hold the bat & bowl the ball which many people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. I was identified as the best bowler of the Lawrence School (my school) at the age of 14 which was a great achievement for me and my parents in the year 2014.Our team is gradually growing day by day. We are playing many cricket matches at national level. My aim is to play internationally.</p>

        <p>Since childhood, I was interested in cricket. I used to play cricket with my dad every evening. He also gifted me a cricket kit on my last birthday.I like this game for many reasons. I have a passion for this game. Playing this game makes me very happy.

When I play cricket, I am fully involved in it. It makes my mind and body active. I not only enjoy playing cricket but also watching it with my friends.

It is always exciting to watch my favorite teams pitched up against each other. This game requires team efforts so it teaches bonding, decision making and team spirit.



India is my favorite cricket team and my favorite player is MS.dhoni. He has won my hearts including mine.I get a lot of inspiration from him.

I always wanted to become a bowler. I know that as a bowler, a person must put in hours of physically rigorous work to earn wickets for his team.

That is why I chose to bowl for my team. I also like to take catches and stop ball from crossing the boundary.

I started playing cricket when I was just 7 years old. Now I am so much addicted to this game. If someone asks me to play cricket from morning to evening, I would happily do that too.
